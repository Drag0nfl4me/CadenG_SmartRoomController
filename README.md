# Smart Room Controller 3-Pawn Game

A midterm assignment for CNM internet of things. The task was to control 6 smart lights, 
and 2 wemos with a unique design and theme. My final concept was to complete circuits using resistor 
housing pawns. Once completed the voltage out put would change and could be read by analog pins.

## Parts used in this project 

* Resistor 1k ohm
* Through Hole Resistor, 560 ohm
* Resistor 2.21k ohm
* Adafruit NeoPixel Ring: WS2812 5050 RGB LED
* ElectroPeak 0.96" OLED 64x128 Display Module
* Particle Argon

## 3D Design

OnShape
* Modeled pawns that were designed to let in certain light levels
* Modeled pawn prototypes that could complete resistors with any inserted resistor

Adobe Illustrator
* laser cut several board variations and a box

### Learning Objectives

* Learn to compress code and make more efficient
* Create my first project from scratch and get the results clost to or exactly what i'm looking for
